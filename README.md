here is all what you need to know. 

This piece of software does the following. 

1. Collects all the vacancies active recently.
2. uses pandas, numpy, seaborn, pillow etc to create beautiful (sometimes ugly though) and share those in facebook.
3. People apply to those vacancies
4. Once people apply, the Application is forwarded to Job-sites, agents, companies, hrs. etc.

   I am solving one problem at a time.
   This time it is to make sure, the vacancy published reaches the right people
   and make sure the applicant reaches the right hiring managers.

   There is little bit of everything in this project, a bit of scrapping, little bit of pillow, a lot of emails and most importantly jobs for those who deserve.


   This is a also a free service. Nothing is charged, never from nobody.

   Unlike other projects this project is done to for self satisfaction, others are for money.

The point of putting all this information here is. 
1. when hiring managers get a lot of emails, they will search and the search probably will land here. They know the purpose and then they will hire.
2. That is it and all. 


and yes, if you want to reach out, here is my  email

At this stage, since this is done purely voluntarily, taking the credit and stealing it is not the right thing, as none of this is about me.
